            <p>
                Implementing Part A using custom CSS Flexbox was a great learning experience, but it was also challenging. I had to make sure the layout looked good on different screen sizes and browsers, which took a lot of time and effort. On the other hand, Part B using Bootstrap was much faster and easier. Bootstrap's pre-built classes and components saved me a lot of time, and I was able to create a consistent design with minimal effort.

            <p>
                However, I did encounter some challenges with Part B. One of the biggest challenges was trying to match the exact layout of the original HTML page. Because of version differences between Bootstrap and the original HTML page, some sections looked bigger or smaller in the Bootstrap version, and it was hard to refine the layout to an exact match. Despite this, I found Part B to be easier and more efficient overall, and I would prefer it for rapid prototyping. But I'm glad I learned about CSS Flexbox in Part A, as it gave me a deeper understanding of responsive design principles.
